    <h1>343 f22 p1 report</h1>

    <ol>
        <li>Your site must contain at least five separate pages, each having a meaningful purpose. One of the files should be named index.html. Your pages must link to each other in a logical and meaningful flow. 
            <ul>
                <li>report.html does not count toward the five, but index.html does.</li>
                <li>I have 6 pages, index.html, live.html, login.html, register.html, stats.html, and tournaments.html</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Each page must declare its favicon (fine and possibly preferred to use the same one for all pages). 
            <ul>
                <li>I have done this, though if I were to use this site for its intended use I would change the icon</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Your site must include some sort of header. 
            <ul>
                <li>This instruction is somewhat unclear, but my main page has a skimpy introduction to the website</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Your site must include some sort of navigation links. 
            <ul>
                <li>I used a navbar at the top of screen with links to each relevant page</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Your site must support distinct layouts for large and small screens using media queries. Use comments to note where you completed this activity. You may do this in a variety of ways. Consider using this to control images or switching blocks between rows (for large screens) and columns (for small). 
            <ul>
                <li>The way most of my content is laid out doesn’t really depend on the size of the screen, but I did use media query for managing my navbar and for removing the twitchchat embed if the screen is too small on my live game page</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Your site must include images, and their alt attributes must adequately describe the image content to users of screen readers, users with images disabled, and webcrawlers. 
            <ul>
                <li>I only have two images and a logo that is visible on the top of the screen, but they all have usefully descriptive alt tags</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Each page and stylesheet of your site must validate without any warnings or errors using the NU Validator and WAVE web accessibility evaluator
            <ul>
                <li>The only errors I get on NU are from live.html where the height and width parameters say they should not be percentages, but twitch’s embed instructions directly say that they can be</li>
                <li>I also have many redundant links in my page because this website is going to be used and have content populated by an api program my roommate is making, but I need javascript to make that work, which we were instructed not to do.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Your site must use at least two different font faces. Headings are often rendered in a sans-serif font, and paragraph copy in a serif font. 
            <ul>
                <li>My style.css has like 4 different fonts in its family in body, but I made my home banners beforehand and they have serifs while the rest of my page does not ☹</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Your site must include at least one form. The form need not do anything at this point in your learning, but it must be present and it must use built-in content verification. Like all content, it must be neatly aligned. 
            <ul>
                <li>not sure what you mean by content verification in this sense, but I have a styled setup to login or make an account (it doesn’t work)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Your site must include links to external sites. 
            <ul>
                <li>Most of the links I have to external sites are placeholders for more internal content that is dependent on a database I haven’t made yet. If I were to make a proper link for the about us page, it would be a page made by my roommate</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Your site must be available at https://tbanks582.github.io/343-f22-p1 
            <ul>
                <li>it is done.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
